# Boundaries

-   How to integrate third party code or libraries from other packages?
-   Separate the third party code as much as possible - depend on something _you_ control, not the third party.

## Wrapper classes

-   Try wrapping third party code in classes you control that expose exactly the functionality you want.

## Learn Third Party APIs through tests

-   Write a test for how you think it should work in your application, _then_ start to debug if the tests fail.
