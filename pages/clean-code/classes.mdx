# Classes

## Overall Organization

Should read like a newspaper - important information up top, details below.

```
class Example {
	// public static constants
	public static A = 1;
	public static B = 2;

	// private static variables
	private static C = 3;
	private static D = 4;

	// private instance variables
	private name!: string;
	private age!: number;

	// public instance variables (really shouldn't have these though)
	public weight!: number;
	public height!: number;

	// constructor
	constructor(...args: any[]) {}

	// public methods + private methods they use
	public run1(): void {
		this.util1();
	}
	private util1(): void {}

	public run2(): void {
		this.util2();
	}
	private util2(): void {}
}
```

## Classes should be small!

-   Follow the [Single Responsibility Principle](/solid-principles/single-responsibility)
-   Minimize the number of instance variables.
-   Example: SQL Generator Class

    -   Bad
        ```
        class Sql {
            public select() {}
            public selectAll() {}
            public insert() {}
            public preparedInsert() {}
            public findByKey() {}
            public create() {}
        }
        ```
        -   Not only does this have too many responsibilities (it tries to do _all_ SQL generation),
            but it violates the [Open-Closed Principle](/solid-principles/open-closed) - if you want to add a new "update" SQL statement, you'd have to modify the existing class.
    -   Better

        ```
        abstract class Sql {
            abstract generate(): string;
        }

        class SelectSql extends Sql {
            generate(): string {
                return 'select id from ...';
            }
        }
        class SelectAllSql extends Sql {
            generate(): string {
                return 'select * from ...';
            }
        }
        class InsertSql extends Sql {
            generate(): string {
                return 'insert into ...';
            }
        }
        class CreateSql extends Sql {
            generate(): string {
                return 'create table ...';
            }
        }
        ```

        -   Each class deals with only a certain type of SQL statement.
        -   In line with the [Open-Closed Principle](/solid-principles/open-closed) - if you want a new SQL statement, you just need a new class!
