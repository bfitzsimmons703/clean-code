# Comments

-   Comments are necessary when the code itself doesn't express our ideas well enough
    -   And even then, think about ways to make the code clearer before turning to comments

## Having no comments is better than having bad/incorrect comments

## Clear code with few comments > complex code with lots of comments

-   Bad
    ```
    if ((employee.flags & HOURLY_FLAG) && employee.age > 64) {...}
    ```
-   Better
    ```
    if (employee.isEligibleForBenefits()) {...}
    ```

## Acceptable Comments

-   Examples of input/output
-   Legal comments (copyright, license, etc)
-   Explanation of intent
    -   Example:
        ```
        function testConcurrentDBConnections() {
            // We want to test multiple connections to our database at once, and this is the best way to do it in the dev environment
            for (let i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
                const dbConn = new DBConn();
                dbConn.ping();
            }
        }
        ```
-   TODOs (though really you should just do it up front)
-   JSDocs for public APIs
