# Error Handling

## Use Exceptions Rather than Return Codes

-   Bad

    ```
    enum ResultStatus {
        Success: 1,
        Error: 2,
    }

    function foo() {
        const result = getResult();
        if (result.status === ResultStatus.Success) {
            //
        } else if (result.status === ResultStatus.Error) {
            //
        } else {
            //
        }
    }
    ```

    -   You have to remember to check each status code
    -   The error handling is in line with the result handling

-   Better
    ```
    function foo() {
        try {
            const result = getResult();
            //do stuff with result
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            logger.log(e);
        }
    }
    ```
    -   Separates the error handling from the result handling

## Provide Context with your Exceptions

-   Either through logging or comments

## Define Exception classes in terms of the caller's needs

-   Wrap third party APIs that throw their own esoteric exceptions with your own classes that throw exceptions your code can understand.

## Don't Return Null!

-   We're creating more work for ourselves because our calling code then needs to check if the result is null or not.
-   If you forget to check if it's null or not, you can miss errors and get null pointer exceptions at runtime.

## Don't Pass Null either!

-   Because then we have to check if the arguments are null in our functions.
