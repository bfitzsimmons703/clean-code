# Simple Design

You can achieve clean code by following these 4 rules of simple design:

1. Run all the tests
    - And keep them running as you make changes.
      If you have the tests running, you don't need to worry about breaking your code as you refactor.
    - Testable code = clean code.
      It naturally reduces coupling, encourages small classes/functions and the [Single Responsibility Principle](/solid-principles/single-responsibility).
2. Eliminate duplication
    - Duplication = bugs and headaches.
3. Express yourself clearly
    - Think of future developers that will read your code. Will it be easy for them to understand?
    - Choose sensible variable names.
    - Keep functions and classes small.
    - Follow standards as set out by the industry and your team.
    - Write expressive unit tests. Tests double as documentation.
4. Minimize the number of classes and methods
    - Try to, at least. Don't create an interface for every class if you don't have to.
      Remember, design patterns and principles are suggestions, not iron clad rules. Don't apply them blindly.
