# Testing

Testing impacts design. Testable code = Decoupled code = Clean code.

## 3 Laws of Test Driven Development (TDD)

1. You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.
2. You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail (including not compiling).
3. You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.

The tests and code are written together, in minutes long intervals.

By writing tests first, we write our code with the point of view of the caller, not the coder.
This forces us to write a more user-friendly interface and code that is decoupled from its environment.

## Clean Tests

-   Structure: _Given-When-Then_

    1. Build (Given) - set up test data
    2. Operate (When) - perform your operation on the test data
    3. Check (Then) - assert that the output of you operation is what you expect

-   Single concept per test

    -   Bad

        ```
        test(() => {
            const game = new Game();
            expect(game.status).toEqual(GameStatus.Ready);

            game.launch();
            expect(game.status).toEqual(GameStatus.Running);

            const score = game.getScore();
            expect(score).toEqual(0);

            game.incrementScore();
            expect(score).toEqual(1);

            game.end();
            expect(game.status).toEqual(GameStatus.Finished);
        });
        ```

        -   Testing both the game lifecycle and the scoring mechanism here

    -   Better

        ```
        test(() => {
            const game = new Game();
            expect(game.status).toEqual(GameStatus.Ready);

            game.launch();
            expect(game.status).toEqual(GameStatus.Running);

            game.end();
            expect(game.status).toEqual(GameStatus.Finished);
        });

        test(() => {
            const game = new Game();
            game.launch();

            const score = game.getScore();
            expect(score).toEqual(0);

            game.incrementScore();
            expect(score).toEqual(1);
        });
        ```

## F.I.R.S.T Rules of Tests

-   Tests should be:

    1. **Fast** - tests should be fast
    2. **Independent** - Tests should NOT depend on other tests. You should be able to run them Independently and in any order.
    3. **Repeatable** - in any environment. Prod, Staging, or Dev.
    4. **Self-Validating** - i.e. they should have a boolean output. Either they pass or fail.
    5. **Timely** - tests should be written just before production code. Design the production code to pass the tests, not the other way around.

## Test Isolation Example: Payroll class

-   Bad

    ```
    class EmployeeDatabase {
        paymentPosted(): boolean {
            //...
        }

        get(employeeId: number): Employee {
            //...
        }

        save(employee: Employee): {
            //...
        };
    }

    class CheckWriter {
        writeCheck(amount: number): void {
            //...
        }

        checkWasWritten(): boolean {
            //...
        }
    }

    class Employee {
        calculatePayment(): number {
            //...
        }

        postPayment(payment: number): void {
            //...
        }
    }

    class Payroll {
        private employeeDB: EmployeeDatabase;
        private checkWriter: CheckWriter;

        constructor(employeeDB: EmployeeDatabase, checkWriter: CheckWriter) {
            this.employeeDB = employeeDB;
            this.checkWriter = checkWriter;
        }

        payEmployee() {
            const employee = this.employeeDB.get(5);
            const payment = employee.calculatePayment();
            this.checkWriter.writeCheck(payment);
            employee.postPayment(payment);
            this.employeeDB.save(employee);
        }
    }

    test('Test Payroll writes check', () => {
        const employeeDB = new EmployeeDatabase();
        const checkWriter = new CheckWriter();

        const payroll = new Payroll(employeeDB, checkWriter);
        payroll.payEmployee();

        expect(checkWriter.checkWasWritten());
        expect(employeeDB.paymentPosted());
    });
    ```

    -   You need to have an actual DB and actual check writer set up to test this

-   Better, with the [Mock Object](/design-patterns/mock-object) design pattern

    ```
    interface EmployeeDatabase {
        paymentPosted(): boolean;
        get(employeeId: number): Employee;
        save(employee: Employee): void;
    }

    interface CheckWriter {
        writeCheck(amount: number): void;
        checkWasWritten(): boolean;
    }

    class Employee {
        calculatePayment(): number {
            //...
        }

        postPayment(payment: number): void {
            //...
        }
    }

    class Payroll {
        private employeeDB: EmployeeDatabase;
        private checkWriter: CheckWriter;

        constructor(employeeDB: EmployeeDatabase, checkWriter: CheckWriter) {
            this.employeeDB = employeeDB;
            this.checkWriter = checkWriter;
        }

        payEmployee() {
            const employee = this.employeeDB.get(5);
            const payment = employee.calculatePayment();
            this.checkWriter.writeCheck(payment);
            employee.postPayment(payment);
            this.employeeDB.save(employee);
        }
    }

    class MockEmployeeDB implements EmployeeDatabase {
        paymentPosted(): boolean {
            throw new Error('Method not implemented.');
        }
        get(employeeId: number): Employee {
            throw new Error('Method not implemented.');
        }
        save(employee: Employee): void {
            throw new Error('Method not implemented.');
        }
    }

    class MockCheckWriter implements CheckWriter {
        writeCheck(amount: number): void {
            throw new Error('Method not implemented.');
        }
        checkWasWritten(): boolean {
            throw new Error('Method not implemented.');
        }
    }

    test('Test Payroll writes check', () => {
        const employeeDB = new MockEmployeeDB();
        const checkWriter = new MockCheckWriter();

        const payroll = new Payroll(employeeDB, checkWriter);
        payroll.payEmployee();

        expect(checkWriter.checkWasWritten());
        expect(employeeDB.paymentPosted());
    });
    ```

    -   Use interfaces that allow you to create mock objects.
        We're testing that the Payroll object does its work, not the CheckWriter or EmployeeDatabase.
    -   Also allows us to swap in different databases and check writers.

## Unit Tests vs Acceptance Tests

Unit tests test a small isolated part of your system. Acceptance tests test the whole thing.
