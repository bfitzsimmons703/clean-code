# Unit Tests

## 3 Laws of Test Driven Development (TDD)

1. You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.
2. You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail (including not compiling).
3. You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.

-   The tests and code are written together, in minutes long intervals.

## Clean Tests

-   Structure: _Given-When-Then_

    1. Build (Given) - set up test data
    2. Operate (When) - perform your operation on the test data
    3. Check (Then) - assert that the output of you operation is what you expect

-   Single concept per test

## F.I.R.S.T Rules of Tests

-   Tests should be:

    1. **Fast** - tests should be fast
    2. **Independent** - Tests should NOT depend on other tests. You should be able to run them Independently and in any order.
    3. **Repeatable** - in any environment. Prod, Staging, or Dev.
    4. **Self-Validating** - i.e. they should have a boolean output. Either they pass or fail.
    5. **Timely** - tests should be written just before production code. Design the production code to pass the tests, not the other way around.
