# Component Cohesion

-   How to group classes?

## Reuse/Release Equivalence Principle (REP)

-   Classes that are grouped together should be _released_ together. IE they share the same version/release number.

## Common Closure Principle (CCP)

-   Group classes that change for the same reasons at the same time.
-   Separate classes that change for different reasons or at different times.
-   I.E. the [SRP Principle](/solid-principles/single-responsibility) for components!

## Common Reuse Principle (CRP)

-   Don't force users of a component to depend on things they don't need.
-   AKA group classes that tend to be reused together (like `User` and `UserBuilder`)
