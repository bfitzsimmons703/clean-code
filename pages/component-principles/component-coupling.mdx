# Component Coupling

How should classes relate to each other?

## Acyclic Dependecies Principle

There should be no dependency cycles among components.
I.E. if you have a dependency graph, you should never be able to follow the edges back to your original component.

    -   A change to any "higher-level" component should not affect those components it depends upon.
    -   I.E. Changing `Main` should affect nothing else.
    -   Also easy to release - you release `Entities`, then `Database` and `Interactors`, etc.
-   Bad

    -   If you want to build and test `Entities`, now you have to couple it with `Authorizer` and `Interactors`.
    -   Harder to release - you have to release those three as one (which may not really be possible).

## How to fix Cyclical Dependecies

-   Apply the [Dependency Inversion Principle](/solid-principles/dependency-inversion).
    -   Abstract out an interface that both `Entities` and `Authorizer` can use.

-   Create new component that both can depend on
