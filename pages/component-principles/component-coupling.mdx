# Component Coupling

How should classes relate to each other?

## Acyclic Dependecies Principle

There should be no dependency cycles among components.
I.E. if you have a dependency graph, you should never be able to follow the edges back to your original component.

-   Good

    -   A change to any "higher-level" component should not affect those components it depends upon.
    -   I.E. Changing `Main` should affect nothing else.
    -   Also easy to release - you release `Entities`, then `Database` and `Interactors`, etc.
-   Bad

    -   If you want to build and test `Entities`, now you have to couple it with `Authorizer` and `Interactors`.
    -   Harder to release - you have to release those three as one (which may not really be possible).

### How to fix Cyclical Dependecies

-   Apply the [Dependency Inversion Principle](/solid-principles/dependency-inversion).
    -   Abstract out an interface that both `Entities` and `Authorizer` can use.

-   Create new component that both can depend on

## Stable Dependecies Principle (SDP)

Components intended to be easy to change should not depend on components that are harder to change.
I.E. "stable" code should not depend on "volatile" code.

-   Stable Code = code that lots of other pieces depend on.

## Stable Abstractions Principle (SAP)

The "stability" of a component is directly related to how "abstract" it is.

-   Interfaces and abstract classes with purely abstract methods are the most stable, since they can be extended easily.
-   Concrete classes are the most volatile.

## SDP + SAP = Dependency Inversion Principle

**Dependecies should run in the direction of stability (i.e. lower level classes should be more stable).
Stable classes are more abstract. Therefore, dependencies should run in the direction of abstractions.**
