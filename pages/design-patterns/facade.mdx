# Facade

-   Provides a simple interface for a group of objects that have complex interfaces themselves.
-   Think of a wrapper class for something complex - you hide the complexity behind a facade of simplicity.

## Example: Database Facade

```
class ProductsDB {
	connection!: Connection;

	init() {}

	insertProducts() {
		this.connection.query('INSERT INTO ...');
	}

	deleteProduct(id: number) {
		this.connection.query(`DELETE FROM ... WHERE id = ${id}`);
	}
}
```

    - Hides the complexity of SQL inserts behind a ProductsDB class.
