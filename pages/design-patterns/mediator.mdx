# Mediator

-   Handles communication between objects so they're independent of each other.
-   Lets you extract all the relationships between classes into a separate class,
    isolating any changes to a specific component from the rest of the components.
    -   All the various objects know about the single Mediator instead of all the other objects in your application.
