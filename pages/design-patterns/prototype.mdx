# Prototype

-   Creational design pattern that lets you copy objects without making your code dependent on the concrete classes.
-   You just create an interface with a single `clone` method, which has a mostly similar implementation for all classes, regardless of properties.
-   UML Diagram:
    -   ![Prototype UML](/prototype-uml.png)

## When to use

-   For when you want to make different copies of a class at runtime without creating subclasses.
-   For your code shouldn't depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy. (IE having to worry about copying specific fields over)

## Example

```
export interface IPrototype {
	clone(): this; //up to you whether it's a deep or shallow copy
}

class Animal implements IPrototype {
	public name: string; //name
	public address: Address; //object
	public owner?: AnimalOwner; //circular reference

	constructor(name: string, address: Address) {
		this.name = name;
		this.address = address;
	}

	clone(): this {
		const clone = Object.create(this);

		clone.address = Object.create(this.address);

		// Cloning an object that has a nested object with backreference
		// requires special treatment. After the cloning is completed, the
		// nested object should point to the cloned object, instead of the
		// original object. Spread operator can be handy for this case.
		if (this.owner) {
			clone.owner = {
				...this.owner,
				animal: { ...this },
			};
		}

		return clone;
	}
}

class Address {
	zip: number;
	street: string;

	constructor(zip: number, street: string) {
		this.zip = zip;
		this.street = street;
	}
}

class AnimalOwner {
	public animal;

	constructor(animal: Animal) {
		this.animal = animal;
	}
}

const animal1 = new Animal('Jesse', new Address(10, 'Main'));
animal1.owner = new AnimalOwner(animal1);

const animal2 = animal1.clone();

if (animal1.name === animal2.name) {
	console.log('Name sucessfully cloned');
} else {
	console.log('Name NOT cloned');
}

if (animal1.address === animal2.address) {
	console.log('Address NOT cloned!');
} else {
	console.log('Address sucessfully cloned');
}

if (animal1.owner === animal2.owner) {
	console.log('Owner NOT cloned');
} else {
	console.log('Owner sucessfully cloned');
}

if (animal1.owner.animal === animal2.owner?.animal) {
	console.log('Circular ref is linked to the original object = BAD');
} else {
	console.log('Circular ref is linked to the cloned object = GOOD');
}
```
