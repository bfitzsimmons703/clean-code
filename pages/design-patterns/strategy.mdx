# Strategy Design Pattern

You define a family of algorithms (like different payment providers or scoring algorithms) in _separate_ classes and make them interchangeable.

Classes can choose whatever implementation of the algorithm they want, and update them at runtime. Leverages composition, since the implementation is a class property.

This lets you add functionality to superclasses without breaking subclasses.

## Example 1: If you have a superclass `Animal` and two subclasses, `Dog` and `Bird`, how do you add a `fly()` method?

-   Bad - add `fly()` method directly to `Animal` superclass

    ```
    export abstract class Animal {
        ...

        public fly(): void {
            console.log('Animal is flying');
        }
    }

    class Dog extends Animal {
        constructor() {
            super();
        }
    }

    class Bird extends Animal {
        constructor() {
            super();
        }
    }
    ```

    -   Now all subclasses are forced to use this implementation unless you override it in each subclass
    -   Also want to avoid adding `fly()` to all subclasses, since that introduces duplication

-   Also Bad - making an interface to FORCE subclasses to adopt fly method

    ```
    interface Flys {
        fly(): void;
    }

    class Animal implements Flys {...}

    class Dog extends Animal {
        constructor() {
            super();
        }

        //NEED TO IMPLEMENT FLY NOW
    }

    class Bird extends Animal {
        constructor() {
            super();
        }

        //NEED TO IMPLEMENT FLY NOW
    }
    ```

    -   Now Dog and Cat break unless you implement the fly method, and a superclass change should NOT break subclasses
    -   This will also lead to duplication, since you have to implement fly everywhere anyway

-   Better, with the Strategy Pattern

    ```
    // Make an interface to implement all the different behavior of flying, and make that an instance variable on the flying class
    // Subclasses can set whatever "flying" type they want
    // Let's you change the behavior at runtime without side effects
    // Can start the Animal as ItFlys, then switch to CantFly without breaking other subclasses

    interface Flys {
        fly(): void;
    }

    //Make classes that define any type of "flying" behavior you want
    class ItFlys implements Flys {
        public fly(): void {
            console.log('FLYING');
        }
    }

    class CantFly implements Flys {
        public fly(): void {
            console.log('NOT FLYING');
        }
    }

    class SuperFly implements Flys {
        public fly(): void {
            console.log('I AM FLYING FAST');
        }
    }

    export abstract class Animal {
        private flyingType!: Flys;

        public setFlyingType(newFlyingType: Flys): void {
            this.flyingType = newFlyingType;
        }

        public tryToFly(): void {
            this.flyingType.fly();
        }
    }

    class Dog extends Animal {
        constructor() {
            super();
            this.setFlyingType(new CantFly());
        }
    }

    class Bird extends Animal {
        constructor() {
            super();
            this.setFlyingType(new ItFlys());
        }
    }

    const dog: Animal = new Dog();
    dog.tryToFly();

    const bird: Animal = new Bird();
    bird.tryToFly();

    // Can change behavior at runtime!
    dog.setFlyingType(new SuperFly());
    dog.tryToFly();
    ```

## Example 2: Implementing a payment strategy

-   Bad - long list of conditionals depending on the type of payment processor

    ```
    class PaymentProcessor {
        public processPayment(paymentType: string) {
            switch (paymentType) {
                case 'PayPal':
                //...
                case 'Stripe':
                //...
                case 'ApplePay':
                //...
                case 'GooglePay':
                //...
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    -   Violates the single-responsibility principle, because now this class is handling lots of different payment logic

-   Better

    ```
    interface PaymentProvider {
        pay(): void;
    }

    class PayPal implements PaymentProvider {
        pay(): void {
            console.log('PAYING WITH PAYPAL');
        }
    }

    class Stripe implements PaymentProvider {
        pay(): void {
            console.log('PAYING WITH STRIPE');
        }
    }

    class PaymentProcessor {
        paymentProvider!: PaymentProvider;

        constructor(paymentProvider: PaymentProvider) {
            this.paymentProvider = paymentProvider;
        }

        public setPaymentProvider(newProvider: PaymentProvider) {
            this.paymentProvider = newProvider;
        }

        public processPayment() {
            this.paymentProvider.pay();
        }
    }

    const processor = new PaymentProcessor(new PayPal());
    processor.processPayment();

    processor.setPaymentProvider(new Stripe());
    processor.processPayment();
    ```

## When to use

-   When you want to use one of several, similar behaviors dynamically among several subclasses

## Benefits

-   Prevents changes on one class from affecting other classes

-   Reduces long if/else and switch statements
    ```
    if (this.canFly) {
        ...
    } else if (this.cantFly) {
        ...
    } else if (this.superFlys) {
        ...
    }
    ```

## Downsides

-   Increased number of interfaces/classes
