# Formatting

-   Most important point: have a set of team rules that everyone sticks to.
-   Example: ESLint config file

## Newspaper metaphor

-   Put the most important information at the top!
-   Should read like a newpaper column:
    -   Descriptive name up top to give you a general overview of what you're reading
    -   High level details below that
    -   Low level details towards the bottom

## Related concepts should occupy the same vertical space. Separate concepts should have empty lines between them.

## Dependent functions should be vertically close, with the calling function ABOVE the called function.

    - This gives the code a nice vertical reading flow, where high level functions are above low level functions.

## Indent short `if/while` blocks

    - Easier to read in the long run.
    - Bad
        ```
        if (x > 0) return;
        ```
    - Better
        ```
        if (x > 0) {
            return;
        }
        ```
