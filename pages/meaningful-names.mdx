# Meaningful Names

We want our code to be as easy to read as possible. A paperback, not an academic paper.

## Use Intention Revealing Names

-   Specify what is measured and the units

        ```
        let elapsedTimeInDays;
        let elapsedTimeInHours;
        ```

        - Bad
        	```
        	public getList(): number[][] {
        		const list1: number[][] = [];
        		for (const l of this.mainList) { //what is mainList?
        			if (l[0] === 4) { //why is the zeroth index important? What is 4?
        				list1.push(l);
        			}
        		}
        		return list1;
        	}
        	```
        - Better (example: Game Board)
        	```
        	public getFlaggedRows(): number[][] {
        		const flaggedRows: number[][] = [];
        		for (const row of this.gameBoard) {
        			if (row[STATUS_CELL] === FLAGGED) {
        				flaggedRows.push(row);
        			}
        		}
        		return flaggedRows;
        	}
        	```

## Avoid Disinformation

    -   Bad
        ```
        let accountList: Record<string, string> = {}; //THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY A LIST
        let name: f64; //why would name be a float?
        ```
    -   Better
        ```
        let accounts: Record<string, string> = {};
        let name: string;
        ```

## Make Meaningful Distinctions

    - Avoid "noise words" like info or data
    - Avoid sequencing variables with numbers

    	-   Bad
    		```
    		let group1;
    		let group2;
    		let group3;
    		```
    	-   Better
    		```
    		let teachers;
    		let students;
    		let parents;
    		```
    		***
    	-   Bad
    		```
    		public copyChars(s1: string, s2: string): string {
    			for (let i = 0; i < s1.length; i++) {
    				s2[i] = s1[i];
    			}
    		}
    		```
    	-   Better
    		```
    		public copyChars(source: string, destination: string): string {
    			for (let i = 0; i < source.length; i++) {
    				destination[i] = source[i];
    			}
    		}
    		```
    		---
    	- Bad
    		```
    		let nameString: string;
    		let accountsInfo: Record<string, string>;
    		```
    	- Better
    		```
    		let name: string;
    		let accounts: Record<string, string>;
    		```

## Use Searchable Names

-   Make it easy for someone to find in a body of code
-   Short names should only appear in small functions and be confined to the function's scope

## Class Names

-   Nouns or noun phrases (`Customer`, `Post`)
-   Avoid vague words like `Manager`,`Processor`,`Data`, or `Info`

## Method Names

-   Verbs or verb phrases (`save`, `deletePage`)

## Pick One Word per Abstract Concept

-   Bad

    ```
    user.get();
    admin.fetch();
    player.retrieve();

    class UserManager {}; //also just a bad class name, too vague
    class PlayerController {};
    ```

-   Better

    ```
    user.get(); //pick one word for the abstract concept of "getting" a record
    admin.get();
    player.get();

    class UserController {};
    class PlayerController {};
    ```
