# Objects and Data Structures

-   Objects/Classes hide data and expose behavior.
    -   They abstract away internal data and instead provide meaningful functions for interacting with that data.
-   Data Structures expose their data but have no meaningful functions/behavior
    -   I.E. classes with just public variables and no methods.
-   Avoid hybrids of the two!

## Data Abstraction

    - Hide the low level implementations of a class. Don't expose the details.
    - Bad
        ```
        class Point {
            public x: number;
            public y: number;
        }

        const point = new Point(0,0);
        point.x = 10; //you have access to the implementation details!
        ```
    - Better
        ```
        class Point {
            private x: number;
            private y: number;
            public setCoordinates(x: number, y: number) {
                this.x = x;
                this.y = y;
            }
        }

        const point = new Point();
        point.setCoordinates(10, 10); //we now access the coordinates through an abstraction
        ```
    - More than hiding variables behind getters/setters. All about hiding them behind abstractions that get at the essence of the data.
    - Bad
        ```
        interface Car {
            getFuelCapacityInGallons(): number;
            getCurrentGallonsOfFuel(): number;
        }
        ```
    - Better
        ```
        interface Car {
            getPercentFuelRemaining(): number;
        }
        ```

## Data Structure vs Object in code

### **Procedural Code** = code that uses data structures

-   Example:

    ```
    // Data structure
    class Square {
        sideLength!: number;
    }

    // Data structure
    class Circle {
        radius!: number;
    }

    // Object
    class Geometry {
        public getArea(shape: any): number {
            if (shape instanceof Square) {
                return Math.pow(shape.sideLength, 2);
            } else if (shape instanceof Circle) {
                return Math.PI * Math.pow(shape.radius, 2);
            } else {
                throw new Error('Unknown shape');
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    -   If I add a new `perimiter()` method to `Geometry`, that's easy, because none of the `Shape` data structures are affected. Nor is any class that uses `Shape`.
    -   If I add a new `Shape` though, I need to update all the `Geometry` methods to deal with it.

### _Procedural code makes it easy to add new functions without affecting existing data structures, but harder to add new data structures without affecting existing functions._

    - We can add a new `perimeter()` method to Geometry without affecting the shape classes
    - But we can't add new shape classes without affecting the existing `getArea()` function on Geometry

### **Object Oriented Code** = code that uses objects/classes

-   Example:

    ```
    interface Shape {
        getArea(): number;
    }

    // Object
    class Square implements Shape {
        sideLength!: number;
        getArea(): number {
            return this.sideLength * this.sideLength;
        }
    }

    // Object
    class Circle implements Shape {
        radius!: number;
        getArea(): number {
            return Math.PI * Math.pow(this.radius, 2);
        }
    }
    ```

    -   Polymorphic, so I don't need a separate `Geometry` class.
    -   Now, if I add a new shape, no existing shape functions are affected.
    -   BUT, if I add a new function, all of the existing shapes must be updated.
        -   I.E. adding a new `perimeter()` method to the `Shape` interface.

### _OO Code makes it easy to add new data structures without affecting existing functions, but harder to add new functions without affecting existing data structures._

    - We can add new shapes without affecting any existing shape's `getArea()` function.
    - But we can't add a new `perimiter()` function without updating all existing shapes.

### So if you want to add new data structures (types) a lot, use OO. If you want to add new functions and new behaviors, use procedural.

## Law of Demeter:

-   All about hiding internal implementations of objects from functions that use those objects.
-   More precisely, a method _f_ of class **C** should only invoke methods of:

    -   The class **C**

        ```
        class C {
            foo() {
                this.bar();
            }

            bar() {
                //...
            }
        }
        ```

    -   An object created by _f_
        ```
        class C {
            foo() {
                const bar = new Bar();
                bar.run();
            }
        }
        ```
    -   An object passed in to _f_
        ```
        class C {
            foo(obj: Object) {
                obj.bar();
            }
        }
        ```
    -   An object held as an instance variable of **C**
        ```
        class C {
            this.bar: Object = new Object();
            foo() {
                this.bar.run();
            }
        }
        ```

### When you have an object, you tell it to _do something_. You don't ask about its internals.

## DTOs and Active Records

-   Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are the essential form of data structures - classes with just public variables and no methods.
    -   Think JavaScript objects
    -   Good for transferring data bewteen APIs or databases
-   Active Records are DTOs that translate to/from a database table, and often have `save()`, `find()`, and other navigational methods.
    -   They should NOT have business logic beyond that though.
-   **Example**: Instead of having a `User` class with private variables that map to database columns, plus a hundred methods around the concept of a "user",
    make the `User` class an Active Record.
    Then, create other "business logic" classes that hold the `User` data structure internally and do whatever operations you need around that, hiding it behind abstractions.

    -   Bad

        ```
        // All encompassing "User" class
        class User {
            private name!: string;
            private database: any;

            public getName(): string {
                return this.name;
            }

            public setName(newName: string) {
                this.name = newName;
            }

            public save(): void {
                this.database.query('INSERT INTO ...');
            }

            public login(): void {
                console.log(`Logging in user`);
            }

            public getUserSession(): object {
                return {
                    name: this.getName(),
                    loginTime: Date.now(),
                };
            }
        }
        ```

    -   Better

        ```
        // Active Record
        class User {
            private database: any;
            private name!: string;

            public getName(): string {
                return this.name;
            }

            public setName(newName: string) {
                this.name = newName;
            }

            public save() {
                this.database.query('INSERT INTO ...');
            }

            public find() {
                this.database.query('SELECT name FROM ...');
            }
        }

        // Business logic class. Hides away internal "user" data structure and just exposes behavior around that user
        class UserSession {
            user!: User; //an active record
            sessionStore: any;

            loginUser() {
                this.sessionStore.add(this.user);
            }

            getUserSession(): object {
                return {
                    name: this.user.getName(),
                    time: Date.now(),
                };
            }
        }
        ```
