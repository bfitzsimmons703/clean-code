# OOP Review

## Inheritance

-   Subclasses inherit the properties and methods of parent class

```
export class Animal {
	private sound: string = '';

	public setSound(newSound: string): void {
		this.sound = newSound;
	}

	public getSound(): string {
		return this.sound;
	}
}

class Dog extends Animal {
	constructor() {
		super();
		this.setSound('bark');
	}

	public digHole(): void {
		console.log('Dug hole');
	}
}

class Cat extends Animal {
	constructor() {
		super();
		this.setSound('meow');
	}
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.digHole(); //dug hole
console.log(dog.getSound()); //bark

const cat = new Cat();
console.log(cat.getSound()); //meow
```

### When to use Inheritance

-   "Is a" rule
-   When the subclass needs most of the
-   DON'T use inheritance just to reuse code, or if the "is a" relationship doesn't exist

## Polymorphism

-   Allows subclasses to change/add methods without affecting parent class

    ```
    const dog: Dog = new Dog();
    dog.digHole(); //this works because the Dog class has its own digHole() method

    const dog: Animal = new Dog();
    dog.digHole(); //Does NOT work. Animal class does not know about the digHole method
    ```

## Abstract Classes

-   Forces a "contract" on subclasses without actually implementing the details
-   You can't instantiate abstract classes by themselves

    ```
    export abstract class Creature {
    	protected sound!: string;

    	public setSound(newSound: string): void {
    		this.sound = newSound;
    	}

    	public abstract makeSound(): void;
    }

    class Liger extends Creature {
    	constructor() {
    		super();
    		this.setSound('Meowroar');
    	}

    	public makeSound(): void {
    		console.log(this.sound);
    	}
    }

    const liger = new Liger();
    liger.makeSound();
    ```

## Interfaces

-   Class or object where everything is abstract

    ```
    interface Props {
    	name: string;
    	link: string;
    }

    const props: Props {
    	name: 'Liger',
    	link: 'liger'
    }

    ---

    export interface NamedCreature {
    	name: string;
    	printName: () => void;
    }

    class Puppy implements NamedCreature {
    	name: string = 'Puppy';
    	printName() {
    		console.log(this.name);
    	}
    }

    const pup = new Puppy();
    pup.printName();
    ```
