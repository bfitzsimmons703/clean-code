# Comments

1. Inappropriate information
    - Example - tracking history in comments. Use source control!
2. Obsolete comments
3. Redundant comments
    - `i++; // increments i`
    - JSDocs that do nothing but retell the function signature
4. Poorly written comments
5. Commented out code
    - Tends to rot. Delete it! You can always see it in source control
