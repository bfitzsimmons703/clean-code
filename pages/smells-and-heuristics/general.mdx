# General

1. "Principle of Least Surprise" - code should do what you expect, not surprise you

    - Example - `stringToDay` should do exactly that: convert a string to a Day

        ```
        export enum Day {
            Monday,
            Tuesday,
        }

        const stringToDay = (dayName: string): Day => {
            switch (dayName.toLowerCase()) {
                case 'monday':
                    return Day.Monday;
                case 'tuesday':
                    return Day.Tuesday;
                default:
                    throw new Error('Unknown string day name');
            }
        };
        ```

    * If code surprises us, we trust it less

2. DRY and reduce duplication
    - Every piece of duplication is a missed opportunity for abstraction
    - Switch cases and if-then statements can be refactored into [polymorphism](/clean-code/oop-basics)
3. Put code at the right level of abstraction
    - High level concepts in base classes, low level details in derivatives
4. Base classes should NOT depend on derivatives
5. Less is more - classes should have small interfaces (i.e. a small number of public methods to call)
    - The more methods/variables a class has, the higher the coupling between different systems
6. Remove dead code
    - You can always find it in source control
7. Vertical separation - limit vertical space between callee and caller
    - Variables should be defined just _above_ their first use! Don't separate the variables and the methods that call them
    - Private methods should be defined just _below_ their first use.
8. Avoid "selector arguments": better to have multiple, smaller functions than one big function with an argument that "selects" internal behavior
    - I.E. boolean arguments with if-else blocks
9. When in doubt, prefer nonstatic methods over static methods
    - This way, you can make the method polymorphic if need be
10. Explanatory variables - break up calculations into intermediate values held be variables with meaningful names

    - Example;

        ```
        // Bad
        people[0]['fullName'].split(' ');

        // Better
        const firstPerson: Person = people[0];
        const fullName: string = firstPerson['fullName'];
        const [firstName, lastName] = fullName.split(' '):
        ```

11. Function names should say what they do

    - Example:

        ```
        // Bad
        date.add(5); // add 5 what? Days, hours?

        // Better
        date.addDays(5);
        ```

12. Prefer polymorphism over if/else and switch blocks
13. Replace magic numbers and strings with named constants
14. Encapsulate conditions

    - Example:

        ```
        // Bad
        if (age >= 18 && age <= 64) {...}

        // Better
        if (canBeDrafted(age)) {...}
        ```

15. Avoid negative conditionals

    - Example:

        ```
        // Bad
        if (isNotASandwich(meal)) {...}

        // Better
        if (isASandwich(meal)) {...}
        ```

16. Functions should do one thing (see the [SRP](/solid-principles/single-responsibility))
17. Make temporal coupling explicit

    - Example:

        ```
        // Bad - nothing to stop another dev from calling these out of order
        ready();
        getSet();
        go();

        // Better - make subsequent functions depend on the outcome of the prior function
        const isReady = ready();
        const isSet = getSet(isReady);
        go(isSet);
        ```

18. Functions should descend only one level of abstraction.
    - Everything within the function should be the same level of abstraction, all one level lower than the named function
19. Law of Demeter - Write shy code
    - I.E. modules should only know about their immediate neighbors. See [Objects and Data Structures](/clean-code/objects-and-data-structures)
    - Avoid things like `a.getB().getC().getD()` - too rigid
