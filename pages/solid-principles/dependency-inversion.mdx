# Dependency Inversion Principle

-   The most flexible system is one that depends on abstractions, not concretions.
-   Those abstractions, in turn, dictate how to implement the low level code. I.E. through interfaces.

## Implementation Rules:

1. Don't refer to volatile concrete classes. Refer to abstract interfaces instead.
    - See the [Abstract Factory Design Pattern](/design-patterns/abstract-factory)
2. Avoid inheriting from volatile concrete classes.
3. Don't override concrete functions.
    - Create an abstract function with multiple implementations
4. Don't mention the name of anything concrete or volatile. Mention the interface.

## Layering

-   Applications should have clearly defined architectural layers (ie high level policy, mid level implementations, low level utilities).
-   These layers should only interact through interfaces/abstract classes.

### Hollywood Principle

-   _Don't call us. We'll call you_.
-   Notice how, in the diagram above, the _calling_ layer owns the abstraction that the lower layer implements.
-   **The lower level module provides the implementation for interfaces that are declared within, and called by, the upper level modules.**
    -   This is good, because high level policies should dictate the structure of the application, not low level details!

## Example - Store class

    -   Bad

        ```
        class Stripe {
            makePayment() {
                console.log('Making stripe payment');
            }

            checkCreditCard() {
                console.log('Checking stripe cc');
            }

            refund() {
                console.log('Refunding stripe card');
            }
        }

        class Store {
            stripe: Stripe;

            constructor(stripe: Stripe) {
                this.stripe = stripe;
            }

            makePayment() {
                this.stripe.makePayment();
            }

            checkCreditCard() {
                this.stripe.checkCreditCard();
            }

            refund() {
                this.stripe.refund();
            }
        }

        const store = new Store(new Stripe());
        store.checkCreditCard();
        store.refund();
        ```

        -   High level `Store` directly depends on low level `Stripe`.
        -   Would be very difficult to switch to another payment processor, because we'd need to update every method in the `Store` class.

    -   Better

        ```
        interface PaymentProcessor {
            makePayment(): void;
            checkCreditCard(): void;
            refund(): void;
        }

        class Stripe implements PaymentProcessor {
            makePayment() {
                console.log('Making stripe payment');
            }

            checkCreditCard() {
                console.log('Checking stripe cc');
            }

            refund() {
                console.log('Refunding stripe card');
            }
        }

        class Paypal implements PaymentProcessor {
            makePayment() {
                console.log('Making paypal payment');
            }

            checkCreditCard() {
                console.log('Checking paypal cc');
            }

            refund() {
                console.log('Refunding paypal card');
            }
        }

        class Store {
            paymentProcessor: PaymentProcessor;

            constructor(paymentProcessor: PaymentProcessor) {
                this.paymentProcessor = paymentProcessor;
            }

            makePayment() {
                this.paymentProcessor.makePayment();
            }

            checkCreditCard() {
                this.paymentProcessor.checkCreditCard();
            }

            refund() {
                this.paymentProcessor.refund();
            }
        }

        const paymentProcessor = Math.random() < 0.5 ? new Stripe() : new Paypal();
        const store = new Store(paymentProcessor);
        store.checkCreditCard();
        store.refund();
        ```

        -   Now the `Store` class depends on an abstraction (or wrapper) that sets guidelines for how to implement
            the low level Stripe and Paypal classes.
