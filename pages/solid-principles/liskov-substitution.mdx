# Liskov Substitution Principle

-   _Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types_.
-   If "S" is a subtype of "T", then anywhere you use "T" you should be able to use "S"
    -   Example: If you have a superclass `Bird` and a subclass `Penguin`, you should be able to use `Penguin` anywhere you use `Bird`

## What violations looks like

```
class A {
	getBool(): boolean {
		return true;
	}
}

class B extends A {
	getBool(): boolean {
		throw new Error('Not implemented');
	}
}

function f(arg: A) {
	arg.getBool();
}

const a = new A();
f(a); //okay

const b = new B();
f(b); //throws error!
```

-   Bad way of fixing would be to update `f()` to account for `B`'s behavior by checking the type at run time (_Run Time Type Information_).
    But that Violates the [Open-Closed Principle](/solid-principles/open-closed).

## Implications of LSP on inheritence and the `IS-A` relationship

Don't think about the properties or specific methods a subtype might have in common with a base class, but the _behaviors_.

For example, a Square _is a_ Rectangle, but when setting the width and height,
the behaviors diverge because distinguishing between width and height doesn't make sense for Squares.

**Therefore, the IS-A rule may be too broad. When deciding whether to inherit from a base class, instead of asking whether Duck is-a Bird,
ask if Duck is _substituteable_ for Bird as defined by Bird's contract.**

## Design by Contract

-   The author of a class explicitly states a contract for that class, which tells the calling code what behaviors can be relied upon.
-   So users of the base class must not be confused by output of any subclasses.

## Example: Bird Classes

-   Bad

    ```
    class Bird {
        fly() {
            console.log('Flying');
        }
    }

    class Duck extends Bird {
        quack() {
            console.log('Quack quack');
        }
    }

    class Penguin extends Bird {
        swim() {
            console.log('Swimming');
        }

        fly() {
            throw new Error('I cannot fly!');
        }
    }

    function makeBirdFly(bird: Bird) {
        bird.fly();
    }

    const duck = new Duck();
    const penguin = new Penguin();

    makeBirdFly(duck);
    makeBirdFly(penguin); //THROWS ERROR
    ```

    -   Violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because Penguin cannot be used wherever Bird is used!

-   Better

    ```
    abstract class Bird {
        movement!: BirdMovement;
    }

    interface BirdMovement {
        move(): void;
    }

    class FlyingBird implements BirdMovement {
        move(): void {
            console.log('I AM FLYING');
        }
    }

    class SwimmingBird implements BirdMovement {
        move(): void {
            console.log('I AM SWIMMING');
        }
    }

    class Duck extends Bird {
        movement: BirdMovement;
        constructor(movement: BirdMovement) {
            super();
            this.movement = movement;
        }

        quack() {
            console.log('Quack quack');
        }
    }

    class Penguin extends Bird {
        movement: BirdMovement;
        constructor(movement: BirdMovement) {
            super();
            this.movement = movement;
        }
    }

    function moveBird(bird: Bird) {
        bird.movement.move();
    }

    const duck = new Duck(new FlyingBird());
    const penguin = new Penguin(new SwimmingBird());

    moveBird(duck);
    moveBird(penguin);
    ```
