# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

-   **Separate code that different actors depend on**
-   Example: Employee class

    -   Bad
        ```
        class Employee {
            calculatePay(); -> for the Accounting department
            reportHours(); -> for the HR department
            save(); -> for the IT department
        }
        ```
        -   This violates the SRP because this class is now beholden to three different stakeholders, and has three reasons to change.
        -   If `calculatePay()` and `reportHours()` share some common low level function that only Accounting wants to change,
            it'll change for the HR department as well! Bad!
        -   And if each actor wants a change, it'll be harder to merge those changes in the single source file.
    -   Better

        ```
        // simple data structure, no methods
        class EmployeeData {
            id: number;
            name: string;
            hoursWorked: number;
            hourlyRate: number;
        }

        // For Accounting
        class PayCalculator {
            calculatePay(employee: EmployeeData);
        }

        // For HR
        class HourReporter {
            reportHours(employee: EmployeeData);
        }

        // For IT
        class EmployeeSaver {
            save(employee: EmployeeData);
        }
        ```
