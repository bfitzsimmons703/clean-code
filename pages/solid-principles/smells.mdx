# Symptoms of Poor Design

## 1. **Rigidity**

    - The system is hard to change. A simple change requires a cascade of other changes.

## 2. **Fragility**

    - The system is easy to break. A simple change causes multiple failures.

## 3. **Immobility**

    - Parts of the system can't easiy be reused elsewhere.
    - Abstracting those parts out is too risky for the original system.

## 4. **Viscosity**

-   Doing things right is harder than doing things wrong. I.E. it's easier to do "hacks" than to do design-preserving changes.

## 5. **Needless Complexity**

-   The system is over engineered and has unnecessary code.
-   It contains parts you "might" need in the future, but don't need now, leaving lots of dead code.

## 6. **Needless Repetition**

-   The system has lots of duplicated code.
-   Copy and Paste is the root of all evil.

## 7. **Opacity**

-   It's hard to tell what the system is doing, or what the intention is.

-   Use the SOLID principles to remove these symptoms. Don't conform to SOLID blindly before your code even smells. (That leads to Needless Complexity.)
